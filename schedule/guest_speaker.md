Questions 
------------------------------------
- What is most common thread you see on daily basis?
- The toughest attack you had to face.
- Some of the JavaScript vulnerabilities you had to deal with.
- Pentesting, certifications, and normal roadmap for a pentesting carrier
- Legal Implications of Cyber Security Jobs.
- Most surprising thing he's found in his career?
- How Covid-19 and the increase of employees working from home has affected cybersecurity, since that's still a recent and drastic change for some fields.
- What do you do on a daily basis?
- What is one piece of advice you could give to us about how we should write our code to be more secure?
- I would like to know if there's anything in particular that he feels is a "sitting duck" (not enough emphasis on its security)
- Would you feel personally responsible if a vulnerability was found in something you greenlighted? Are there any legal implications for this (would a company potentially try to protect the tester as an employee or shift blame for not finding flaws)?
