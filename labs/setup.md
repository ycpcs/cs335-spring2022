Labs
-----------------------------------
- Hands-on [Labs](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/) for Security Education.

Lab Setup
-----------------------------------
- [Oracle® VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use. User Manual can be found [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/).

- Pre-built Virtual Machine [SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/138fqx0F8bThLm9ka8cnuxmrD6irtz_4m/view?usp=sharing).
  - Primary Account:
    - User ID: seed
    - Password: dees
  - Root account:
    - User ID: root
    - Password: seedubuntu

Manual
-----------------------------------
- Follow [Run SEED VM on VirtualBox](vm-setup.html) to load the image into VirtualBox. This includes the account and password information, list of software and servers installed, and configuration.

Troubleshooting
-----------------------------------
- The first thing you should do after creating your SEED VM is to update your packages; to do that, run the following two commands from your VM:
  - ```sudo apt update```
  - ```sudo apt upgrade```
- If the guest screen is too small:
  - With VirtualBox 6.0.0 you need to go to the VirtualBox Preferences » Display » Scale Factor = 200%.
- When you clone your VM's, make sure the MAC Address Policy is set to __Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters__.

Cheat Sheets
-----------------------------------
#### Networking
- ```ifconfig -a``` displays all network interfaces and IP address.
- ```hostname -I``` displays the IP addresses of the host (all local IP addresses).
- ```host domain``` displays IP address for _domain_.
- ```ping host``` sends ICMP echo request to _host_.
- ```whois domain``` displays whois records for _domain_.
- ```dig domain``` displays DNS information for _domain_.
- ```dig -x IP``` does reverse lookup of _IP_ address.  

#### User Management
- Local user information is stored in the _/etc/passwd_ file. Get the list of all users using ```cat /etc/passwd```. The fields are delimited by colons and contain the following:
  - User name
  - Encrypted password (x means that the password is stored in the ```/etc/shadow``` file)
  - User ID number (UID)
  - User's group ID number (GID)
  - Full name of the user (GECOS)
  - User home directory
  - Login shell (defaults to /bin/bash)
    - If you need a user account with a password for authentication with a system, but do not require an interactive shell
    - _/sbin/nologin_ and _/bin/false_ if the user tries to log in to the system, the nologin shell closes the connection of the user.
- ```id``` display the user and group ids of your current user.
- ```groupadd attacker``` created a group named _attacker_.
- ```useradd -c "John Doe" -m john``` creates an account names _john_ with a comment of _John Doe_.
- ```passwd john``` will set the password for the user _john_
- ```userdel john``` deletes the _john_ account.
  - ```rm -r /home/john``` will delete the home directory of the _john_ account
  - ```su``` temporarily become the superuser
  - ```last``` show last system logins
  - ```who``` displays who is currently logged into the system
  - ```w``` shows which users are logged in and their activity
  - _chmod_ command is used to change the permissions of a file or directory.

#### File Commands and Directory Navigation
- ```cd``` go to _$HOME_ directory.
- ```cd ...``` go one level up the directory tree.
- ```cd /etc``` to change to the _/etc_ directory.  
- ```ls``` list all files.
  - Use ```-R``` to list all-subdirectories as well
  - ```-a``` will list hidden files as well
  - Use the ```-al``` argument to view details
- ```pwd``` lists the present working directory.
- ```mkdir directory``` created a _directory_.
- ```rm -r directory``` removes the _directory_ and its contents recursively. Use the ```f``` argument to forcefully remove, re: ```rm -rf directory```.
- ```touch file``` will create an empty _file_.
- ```rm file``` removes a _flle_.
- ```copy file file2``` will copy _file_ to _file2_.
- ```mv file file2``` renames or moves _file_ to _file2_.
- ```cat filename``` will display the contests of _filename_.
- ```cat > filename```  creates a new file with _filename_.
